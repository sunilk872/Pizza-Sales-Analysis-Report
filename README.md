insights about a year worth of data about all pizza orders made, 48,620 records and 12 columns.

🛢️ The task was to get the exact information to answer 11 important business questions like weekly trend of orders made or the top 5 best pizzas by revenue, to do this I worked with SQL in MySQL Workbench. Imported data from a csv file to the database, dealt with data types and datetime formats and wrote a query for each business question with a way to apply a filter to them.

📑 Made a report in Word with all the business questions answered with their respective SQL query and result set.

📊 Built an interactive report dashboard in Tableau, featuring 5 KPI's and more than 10 charts, some are custom! Includes filters by time period and pizza category for more precise insights. There are 2 versions, one with a custom background made with PowerPoint and the other with Tableau only features.
